# EAST

## Abstract

Spiking neural networks (SNNs) incorporate multiscale dynamics towards a promising prospect of efficient computation. However, the lack of training methods that satisfy efficiency and biological plausibility has strongly limited their future development. Different from their counterpart artificial neural networks (ANNs), which use backpropagation (BP) for efficient learning, the biological brain has resolved this problem to some extent by using dopamine-based global plasticity that generates reward prediction error (RPE) from uniformly important upstream brain regions first and then assigns them into downstream neurons with various types of dopamine receptors. Inspired by this global dopamine-like plasticity, we proposed an expectation-assisted synaptic tuning (EAST) algorithm, whereby the global neuromodulators generated from the expectation-to-RPE transformation can further modulate the local synaptic plasticity of spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), exhibited a biologically plausible synaptic credit assignment of SNNs in both online and incremental learning tasks. Other important features of EAST were also discussed after the network simulation, including lower computational cost with parallel computation and continuous learning with rotational expectations.
