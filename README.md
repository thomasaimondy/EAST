## Abstract

Spiking neural networks (SNNs) incorporate multi-scale dynamics towards a promising prospect of efficient computation. However, the lack of training methods that satisfy both efficiency and biological plausibility has strongly limited their future development. Different from their counterpart artificial neural networks (ANNs) which use backpropagation (BP) for efficient learning, the biological brain has resolved this problem to some extent by using a global dopamine-based plasticity that generates reward prediction error (RPE) from uniformly-important upstream brain regions first and then assigns them into downstream neurons with various types of dopamine receptors. With this inspiration, we showed a global expectation-assisted state tuning (EAST), whereby the global expectation-to-RPE transformation used for neuronal-state modifications incorporated together local spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) used for synaptic modifications, exhibited a biologically plausible feature of efficient online learning while information forward propagation. Further analysis about delay and frequency of this dopamine-based signal revealed a better flexibility and interpretability of the algorithm at single-neuron and cell-assembly scales.
